What have you done since yesterday?
	- Looked into the transfer of UI design on Figma to code
	- Found plugins that could help this transfer be easier and other applications that could be used to create the code

What are you planning on doing today?
   	- Nothing in relation to this course, due to midterm

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- Some plugins are outdated and no longer work
	- Time, midterm today
