Name: Alejandro Iglesias Llobet

What have you done since yesterday?
	- Changed the layout features of certain pages such as
      the color of the main login page to match the overall
      application's main light green and orange colors. 
	- Created the standup file for today's scrum.

What are you planning on doing today?
	- Revisit our first Figma layout rough draft to 
      search for and add any overlooked pages and objects.

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- Time, I had to communicate back and forth with the
      Co-op Office and write a 4-hour long exam.
