What have you done since yesterday?
	- Implemented the already created image url modal to the product creation page
	- Created customers add to cart modal
	- Implemented the add to cart modal so when product is clicked the modal will show
	- Created owners order info modal 
	- Implemented the owners order info modal so when get info is clicked the modal will show

What are you planning on doing today?
   	- Fix spinner layout and create custom spinner layout for order info modal, android default spinner does not look nice

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- Creating the spinner within the modal. Had to change the way I was implementing the modal in order for the spinner to show properly.
