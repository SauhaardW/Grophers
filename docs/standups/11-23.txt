Any impediments or stumbling blocks?

	- Created three pages for the UI in Android studio
	- Completed owner set up profile page

	- Start looking into the backend and trying to understand how to work on it

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- Constraints within android studio were giving me a lot of issues. I had hard coded at first and then realized the pages wouldn't work for all emulators/phone types. I had to go back and fix all of the constrains which ended up causing me to take twice the amount of time I usually would take.
