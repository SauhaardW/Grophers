Name: Alejandro Iglesias Llobet

What have you done since yesterday?
	- Nothing (Slept 18 hours due to illness)

What are you planning on doing today?
   	- Make hamburger buttons work everywhere for
    both customer and user
    - Fix padding on UIs and ensure that it is perfect
    - Watch the CSCB07 lectures for Android Testing and
    Software Testing and begin the testing process for
    the logins of both the customer and owner if I
    still have some time

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- My illness (my headache makes it nearly impossible
    for me to properly focus)
