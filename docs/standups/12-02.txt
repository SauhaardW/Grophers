Name: Sauhaard Walia

What have you done since yesterday?
   	- Created the code for set up store activity and then implemented the feature to create store to enable the owner to add an image url to serve as their stores logo.
	- Ensured that the input by the owner for the store image is being correctly fetched by the listener and then is being accurately added into the firebase database.
	- Removed parts of the code for images for an owner for both creating a product and adding a logo to a store as they were impeding on being able to actually obtain those images from the owner and get the right ones to be displayed.

What are you planning on doing today?
	- Work on creating and making sure the buttons on edit product modal appear nice and and match the color scheme of the entire code
	- Fix the button on owner product list to be able to create a new product due to the functionality of that button currently being lacking
	- Figure out how to make a default button with a custom image background be able to be any other color other than purple as that is what it is currently hard coded to purple for some reason that we can't find in the code

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- Struggled to find ample time today as my MGEB01 assignment took up a large majority of my time today.
