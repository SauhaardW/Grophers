What have you done since yesterday?
	- Fixed the UI of the modal for retaining the image url
	- Changed layout of UI to constraint to make a more pleasing UI

What are you planning on doing today?
   	- Redo some of the UI's which are based on server data
	- Make the UI's based on recycler views

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- To test the UI it takes a lot of time to get to that page. I fixed by making the page a launcher in the manifest for the time being. I removed it once I finished the modal.
