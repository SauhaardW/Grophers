Name: Sauhaard Walia

What have you done since yesterday?
	- On every single page that had a edit text entry box I added padding all around every single edit text entry box on all the pages to make the appearance of the user input text appear better as it was currently looking slightly ugly so I added 10dp of padding.
	- Moved up the invisible limit modal text box to make it be able to cut off the modal page at the right length.

What are you planning on doing today?
   	- Work tirelessly on the back end code for owner product page to be able to constantly refresh and display accurate information as the owner is adding products or editing products as previously it only fetched information once and didn't refresh.
