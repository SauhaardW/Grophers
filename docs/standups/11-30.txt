Name: Sauhaard Walia

What have you done since yesterday?
	- From the beginning started working on the implementation and created the code for enabling the edit product modal to function as desired and also designed in a manner that makes the UI look really good.
	- Create the code for allowing owners to be able to add products and making sure the backend functionality of that works as desired.

What are you planning on doing today?
   	- Work on figuring out how it would be possible to add images to any product the owner wishes to create the product
	- Find out how it can be possible to receive the above information from the owner and then fetch that information and place it into the data backend
	- Ensure that the information fetched by the owner for any of the products they create is accurate and well tested.

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- Initially to figure out how to add images to this code was very difficult and to find out how we can get a user to input a url and how we can then fetch the image for it was initially very challenging
