What have you done since yesterday?
    - Created card for Customer Order Info Modal
    - Implemented "onClick" property for cards within
    the recycler view for the Customer Order Info page
    - Created a new modal for the page and designed the
    layout (with a recycler view and the pricing text
    views at the bottom of the modal)
    - Wrote a small program to always list the proper
    subtotal, taxes and total pricing for the listed
    products (and their respective quantities) within
    the modal
    - Sent a pull request for the finished model
    of the Customer Order Info Modal

What are you planning on doing today?
   	- Nothing (going to sleep early due to illness)

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- My illness (my headache makes it nearly impossible
    for me to properly focus)
